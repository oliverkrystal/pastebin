===Pastebin===

=Why the name?
Because that's what it is, a pastebin and I've given up on trying to make good names for my projects.  Its a pastebin.  That's what it does.  That's what I call it.

=Whatever dude, how to use?
The best way to use it is to read this readme.

First, make a folder
mkdir ~/users/~pastebin/public_html
You will be pointing the root of the domain or subdomain to public_html.  I won't provide specifics because it varies.   It is important that there is no way to access the sub folders of ~/users/~pastebin via http.  Why?

Next step.  Setup another folder in the pastebin folder, called posts.
mkdir ~/users/~pastebin/posts
And that's why.

Upload contents of this repo (you really only need index.php and export.php) and you're done.

=What?
Yup, that's right, no SQL.  I don't know how resistant this thing is to XSS and other attacks but it doens't have to worry about SQL injection flaws.

=Anything else
Nope.  I'm still working on this thing, so check back often :)  And, thanks for using!

Work in progress, more or less stable.

A simple pastebin.

Upload to server (preferably the root of a domain or a sub-domain)
make a folder next to the public html for files to get stored in

the script will error if not setup properly.

Readme might get better ;)
